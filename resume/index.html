                <p>RE: Software Developer && Software Developer / Change Manager<br><br><br>
                
                Dear Hiring Manager,<br><br>
                
                <div class="tab-space"></div>I am pleased to submit my application for the Software Developer and Software Developer / Change Manager positions! I‚Äôve reduced my resume to just my experience here, but while you won‚Äôt see many jobs I‚Äôve had like Salary Manager, 2nd Foreman, security officer, and scheduling coordinator, you will see a history of me consistently being thrust into situations I wasn‚Äôt comfortable or experienced in and overcoming all challenges placed before me. I may not always start with a wealth of knowledge or experience, but one thing I can confidently say is that when I‚Äôm placed in a ‚Äúsink or swim‚Äù scenario, I‚Äôll always teach myself how to swim.<br><br>
                
                <div class="tab-space"></div>I deeply value the relationships I‚Äôve built here and the trust I‚Äôve earned from both colleagues and customers. This trust empowers me to consistently find solutions, no matter the challenge. Whether collaborating with coworkers or assisting customers, I‚Äôve always prioritized the needs of the end-user. My willingness to go beyond the typical scope of support to ensure customer satisfaction was a key factor in my promotion to Service SME.<br><br>
                
                <div class="tab-space"></div>I recognize that there are many skilled individuals here, and I understand the competition for this role is fierce. While I may not be the most experienced in every area, I am confident in my ability to tackle adversity head-on and find a way to succeed. I approach every challenge with determination, using every resource available (ethically, of courseüôÇ) to find solutions and grow.<br><br>
                
                <div class="tab-space"></div>I‚Äôm excited about the opportunity to prove my capabilities in this role, and whether I do so now or in the future, I‚Äôm confident that my dedication and ability to adapt will make me an obvious choice. Thank you for your time and consideration.<br>
